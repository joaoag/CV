<h1 align="center">João Abbott-Gribben</br>❧</h1>


<p>I'm a full stack developer with a background in art and writing. A recent graduate from <a href="https://makers.tech/hire/">Makers Academy</a>, I'm now looking to join an organisation that values clean code, agile working practices and continual learning. I love learning new technologies, pairing, solving puzzles and writing well-designed and test-driven code.</p>
<br>
<p>Before joining Makers I split my time between writing, my art practice and administrative work. The administration was enjoyably systematic and efficient but it didn't offer the intellectual and creative challenges of art and writing, so I started to look for something new. After working on <a href=https://www.theodinproject.com/courses>The Odin Project </a> and Codecademy for a few months, I knew that programming was for me.</p>


## Experience

#### Projects

|**Project**|**Timeframe**|**Description**|**Languages & Technologies**|
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
|KeepAhead [Front End](https://github.com/joaoag/react_front_end_hhh)</br> [Back End](https://github.com/joaoag/KeepAhead_RailsAPI)| 2 weeks| Final project at Makers Academy. Designed to meet the need of giving to those less fortunate in an increasingly cashless world. KeepAhead allows you to donate food and drink at nearby cafes to those less fortunate. The recipient doesn't need a phone, they just need to say the passphrase linked to their donation once they're in the shop. We wanted to balance technical difficulty, having a happy team and making a product that would do social good. | Javascript, React.js, CSS, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, ActiveRecord, Google Maps API, Stripe API, Heroku, Surge</br> Tested with Jest, Enzyme, ESlint, RSpec, SimpleCov, Rubocop |
|[Gilded Rose JS](https://github.com/joaoag/GildedRose-JS)| 3 days | A classic refactoring exercise, really enjoyed TDD-wrestling  the longest if statement I've ever seen into something that adheres to DRY, SRP, LoD etc. | Javascript</br> Tested with Jasmine, ESlint |
|[Bank Tech Test](https://github.com/joaoag/bank_tech_test) | 3 days | Another refactoring exercise, after meeting MVP increasingly strict code design requirements are set (all methods < 5 lines etc.). Bar four line count warnings I met all the 'strict' set of requirements as outlined in the README  | Ruby</br> Tested with RSpec, SimpleCov, Rubocop |
|[Chitter](https://github.com/joaoag/chitter-challenge) | 2 days | A twitter clone made in week 5 of Makers, very happy with balance struck between front end appearance and the back end functionality. | Ruby, Sinatra, Datamapper</br> Tested with RSpec, SimpleCov, Capybara, Rubocop |
|[Instaclone](https://github.com/joaoag/Instaclone) | 2 days| Made in week 8 of Makers, working with images and rails was very satisfying and again I was happy with the balance between front and back end performance. | Ruby, Rails, ActiveRecord, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS</br> Tested with RSpec, SimpleCov, Capybara, Rubocop |
|[Event Planner (SPA)](https://github.com/joaoag/event_planner_spa_js) | 4 days | Only the second week of using javascript so please with being able to implement local storage and get my app talking to a weather API. | Javascript, HTML, CSS</br> Tested with Jasmine and my custom testing framework |

#### Processes

Alongisde learning to code, Makers instills industry best practices in its developers. These are some of the processes I've come to love:

* Agile working practices: 
* TDD
* Git workflow
* Clean code: SOLID, DRY, KISS + Sandi Metz's TRUE
* Growth mindset and independent learning

## Skills

#### Fast learner

I consistently add value to my colleagues and employer in short space of time through the pace of my learning and my ability to assess the qualities and outcomes required by the role. 

Experience / Achievement
- MA examples - built xyz within 12 weeks  
- STAT analysis and visualisation: members survey, resignation stats - within one year, automating input/output for financial admin. Value added: on leaving asked to stay on as lay member of Council 
- Built insight macros NE & HC - within one year 

(Experience, Achievements, Evidence)

#### Flexible
- Excelling in range of roles, all requiring different approaches: admin, project management, editing, writing, art practice 

- STAT
Overall role shifting: financial administration exanding to inc. branding & marketing contribution
Daily role constantly shifting workflows

- Artist practice
A rich practice comes from being alert to the huge potential value of unexpected outcomes

- Arts & Entertainment Editor
Multiple variables (articles, images, writers, subeditors etc.) in constant flux - adapted to and kept track of to ensure copy got to print on time
