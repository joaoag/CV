<h1 align="center">João Abbott-Gribben</br>❧</h1>


<p>I'm a full stack developer with a background in art and writing. A recent graduate from <a href="https://makers.tech/hire/">Makers Academy</a>, I'm now looking to join an organisation that values clean code, agile working practices and continual learning. I love learning new technologies, pairing, solving puzzles and writing well-designed and test-driven code.</p>
<br>
<p>Before joining Makers I split my time between writing, my art practice and administrative work. The administration was enjoyably systematic and efficient but it didn't offer the intellectual and creative challenges of art and writing, so I started to look for something new. After working on <a href=https://www.theodinproject.com/courses>The Odin Project </a> and Codecademy for a few months, I knew that programming was for me.</p>
<br>

<h1 align="center"> Experience</h1>

<h2 align="center"> Processes</h2>

Makers instills industry best practices in its developers, all of the below projects were made by applying:

* Agile product development, particularly XP values and rules (TDD, pair programming, version control, CI etc.)
* Clean code design and refactoring: SOLID, DRY, KISS + Sandi Metz's TRUE
* Growth mindset and conscious methodical processes for debugging, researching, modelling etc.

|**Project**|**Timeframe**|**Description**|**Languages & Technologies**|
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
|KeepAhead [Front End](https://github.com/joaoag/react_front_end_hhh)</br> [Back End](https://github.com/joaoag/KeepAhead_RailsAPI)| 2 weeks| Final project at Makers Academy. Designed to meet the challenge of giving in an increasingly cashless world, KeepAhead allows you to donate food and drink at nearby cafes to those less fortunate. We wanted to balance technical difficulty, team wellbeing and making a product that would do social good. | Javascript, React.js, CSS, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, ActiveRecord, Google Maps API, Stripe API, Heroku, Surge</br> Tested with Jest, Enzyme, ESlint, RSpec, SimpleCov, Rubocop |
|[Gilded Rose JS](https://github.com/joaoag/GildedRose-JS)| 3 days | A classic refactoring exercise, really enjoyed TDD-wrestling  the longest if statement I've ever seen into something that adheres to DRY, SRP, LoD etc. | Javascript</br> Tested with Jasmine, ESlint |
|[Bank Tech Test](https://github.com/joaoag/bank_tech_test) | 3 days | Another refactoring exercise, after meeting MVP increasingly strict code design requirements are set (all methods < 5 lines etc.). Bar four line count warnings I met all the 'strict' set of requirements as outlined in the README  | Ruby</br> Tested with RSpec, SimpleCov, Rubocop |
|[Chitter](https://github.com/joaoag/chitter-challenge) | 2 days | A twitter clone made in week 5 of Makers, very happy with outcomes across the stack. | Ruby, Sinatra, Datamapper</br> Tested with RSpec, SimpleCov, Capybara, Rubocop |
|[Instaclone](https://github.com/joaoag/Instaclone) | 2 days| Made in week 8 of Makers, working with images and rails was very satisfying and again I was happy with the balance between front and back end performance. | Ruby, Rails, ActiveRecord, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS</br> Tested with RSpec, SimpleCov, Capybara, Rubocop |
|[Event Planner (SPA)](https://github.com/joaoag/event_planner_spa_js) | 4 days | Second week of using javascript so was pleased to implement local storage and get my app talking to a weather API. Tested using a framework written the week prior. | Javascript, HTML, CSS</br> Tested with Jasmine and my custom testing framework |
