<h1 align="center"> About me</h1>

<p>I'm an artist and writer turned full stack developer. A recent graduate from <a href="https://makers.tech/hire/">Makers Academy</a>, I'm now looking to join an organisation that values clean code, agile working practices and continual learning. I love learning new technologies, pairing, solving puzzles and writing well-designed and test-driven code.</p>
<br>
<p>Before joining Makers I split my time between writing, my art practice and administrative work. The administration was enjoyably systematic and efficient but it didn't offer the intellectual and creative challenges of art and writing, so I started to look for something new. After working on <a href=https://www.theodinproject.com/courses>The Odin Project </a> and Codecademy for a few months, I knew I'd found it.</p>

<h2 align="center"> Projects</h2>

|**Project**|**Timeframe**|**Description**|**Languages & Technologies**|
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
|KeepAhead [Front End](https://github.com/joaoag/react_front_end_hhh)</br> [Back End](https://github.com/joaoag/KeepAhead_RailsAPI)| 2 weeks</br>Group project| Final project at Makers Academy. Designed to meet the challenge of giving in an increasingly cashless world, KeepAhead allows you to donate food and drink at nearby cafes to those less fortunate. We wanted to balance technical difficulty, team wellbeing and making a product that would do social good. | Javascript, React.js, CSS, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, ActiveRecord, Google Maps API, Stripe API, Heroku, Surge</br> Tested with Jest, Enzyme, ESlint, RSpec, SimpleCov, Rubocop |
|[Gilded Rose JS](https://github.com/joaoag/GildedRose-JS)| 3 days</br>Solo project | A classic refactoring exercise, really enjoyed TDD-wrestling  the longest if statement I've ever seen into something that adheres to DRY, SRP, LoD etc. | Javascript</br> Tested with Jasmine, ESlint |
|[Bank Tech Test](https://github.com/joaoag/bank_tech_test) | 3 days</br>Solo project | Another refactoring exercise except where we have written the initial codebase ourselves. I met all of the 'strict' refactoring requirements (e.g. all methods < 5 lines - see the README for the rest) apart from four line count warnings | Ruby</br> Tested with RSpec, SimpleCov, Rubocop |
|[Chitter](https://github.com/joaoag/chitter-challenge) | 2 days</br>Solo project | A twitter clone made in week 5 of Makers, very happy with outcomes across the stack. | Ruby, Sinatra, Datamapper</br> Tested with RSpec, SimpleCov, Capybara, Rubocop |
|[Instaclone](https://github.com/joaoag/Instaclone) | 2 days</br>Solo project| Made in week 8 of Makers, working with images and rails was very satisfying and again I was happy with the balance between front and back end performance. | Ruby, Rails, ActiveRecord, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS</br> Tested with RSpec, SimpleCov, Capybara, Rubocop |
|[Event Planner (SPA)](https://github.com/joaoag/event_planner_spa_js) | 4 days</br>Group project | Second week of using javascript so was pleased to implement local storage and get my app talking to a weather API. Tested using a framework written the week prior. | Javascript, HTML, CSS</br> Tested with Jasmine and my custom testing framework |

<h1 align="center"> Skills</h1>
<h2 align="center"> Writing clean & well-crafted code</h2>

At Makers we learn a language-agnostic approach to a range of industry best practices for multiple stages of the software cycle. Initially quite theoretical, their benefits quickly became concrete over the numerous group and individual projects. I’ve learnt and become a huge advocate for agile product development, particularly XP values and rules (TDD, pair programming, version control, CI), and clean code designed with SOLID, DRY, KISS + Sandi Metz's TRUE in mind. 
<br>
<h2 align="center">Collaboration & communication</h2>
The collaborating and communicating skills I’ve honed as an artist and writer were further developed by the pair programming and agile practices we were taught at Makers. Open, regular and constructive communication is hugely important to me and I always take steps to do what I can to ensure this happens in the teams I work in. I’ve consistently found that the most productive teams are those where everyone feels valued and heard and difficult conversations are approached with a no-blame solution-orientated approach. These are also the happiest teams!


<h2 align="center">Diligence & attention to detail</h2> 
Whether it’s writing clean code or keeping on top of office administration, I take pleasure in doing things well and learning how they can be done better. For me attention to detail starts at the code I’ve written and keeps expanding from there: I’m passionate about details and consistency at all stages and environments of software development projects. I take as much pride in my code craftsmanship as I do in considerate communication, keeping the task board up to date or uniform commit messages (
[semantic commits](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/semantic_commit_messages)
) , absolutely love them). 


<h2 align="center">High motivation & independence </h2> 
Solving problems, independent learning and working through adversity are hugely rewarding and motivating processes to me. As an artist I’m used to persevering through endless iterations of something ‘not working’ until I get the skills or knowledge required for a breakthrough. At Makers we develop conscious and methodical processes for how to solve problems and learn new skills. More importantly, I’ve practised these processes countless times on the course with really positive results. So when times are dark and I find I’ve made an incorrect assumption, or if there’s a nasty bug (or both, as it often goes) I know that I have the processes and motivation to succeed.
